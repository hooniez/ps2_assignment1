security professionals are required to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availablity of systems and 
data.

confidentiality - prevents information from unauthorised access(takes up a majority of their efforts)
controls:
>preventing people from accessing the information without permission
>encrypting data
>steganography(hides files in other files through embedding)

integrity - Protects information and systems from unauthorised information
authenticity - recepient of a message can be confident the message came from the expected sender.
non-repudiation - the recepient can prove the authenticity of the message to a third party.
control:
>hash functions to see if files were changed/modified	
>digital signatures
>digital certificates

availablity- ensures systems and data are available to used who need it
control:
>redundant components
>high availability(protects setvices against faliure of a single server)
>fault tolerance


Security policy Framerworks

Policies(mandatory):
>provide foundation for security program
>are written carefully over a long period of time
>require compliance from all employees
>are approved at the highest levels of the organisation

Standards(mandatory):
>provide specific details of security controls

Procedures(can be optional or mandatory):
>outline step by step process for an activity


Risk assessment

Threat - external force jepordizing security

vulnerability - weakness in security controls

risk - when there is both vulnerability and threat


Threat Modelling

threat intelligence can be gathered from open source projects.
threat intelligence is guaged by timeliness, accuracy and reliability.

cybersecurity is primarily based on threat hunting as opposed to threat prevention.
