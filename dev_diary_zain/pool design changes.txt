potential pool design(need to implement):

1)pick an arbitrary room
2)use the connected rooms array to determine where there is empty space(where value is None)
3)check to see if there is enough pool space(coords will differ based on the index of connected rooms:bot,top,left,right)
4)if check fails, move on to another room and repeat steps 2 and 3
5)build pool
