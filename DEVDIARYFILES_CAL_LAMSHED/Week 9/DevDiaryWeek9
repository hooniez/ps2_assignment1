RAM

ECC Ram:
More expensive and slower
Does automatic erro correction (corrects for errors causes by background radiation)
Mostly used in deviceds where reliability is critical.

Non-ECC Ram:
Cheaper and faster
Much more used than ECC Ram
No auto correction

DDR Ram:
DDR: Can do read/write opperations at twice the speed of orginal ram.
Operation twice for each clock, 1 per rise 1 per fall
DDR2. 2 Accesses per rise fall of clock
DDR3: Twice the transfer rate as DDR2

Pins:
Connect the ram to motherboard.
More pins is better.
SIMM single line memory. Older version
DIMM Two rows of Pins

Static RAM vs Dynamic RAM:

Static Ram:
Does not need to refresh the storage,
better performance,
More expensive
Not as scalable
Dynamic Ram:
Requires refresh
slower than static
cheaper than static
More scalable.

Motherboard channels slots:
Multiple channels between motherboard and ram.
Duel channel RAM has two 64bit data channels.
Requires Motherboard functionality.
The channels normally alternate

01 ch1
02 ch2
03 ch1
04 ch2

Depending on what you have changes how to combine the channels

Memory timing:
Measures Ram performance.
CAS Latency - Time to access memory column if row is already open
Row Address to column address delay - Time to read fiirst bit without an active row
Row precharge time: Time to access column if wrong row is open
Row active time: Time required to internally refresh row
