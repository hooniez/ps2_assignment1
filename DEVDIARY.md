# Development Diary
This is a *template* for your dev diary in PS2.
Feel free to edit as you see fit e.g., based on your progress updates, hurdles encountered and circumvented.
Make sure to log one comprehensive update per student, per each week of our teaching term.
Please, get in touch with teaching staff for any questions around this or otherwise post on Microsoft Teams.

# Mandatory Student's contributions
Please, specify your individual contributions to the project **as a percentage**. 
Default is a *25% contribution for each student*. However, please modify as necessary, if that is not the case.
